# GAN Loss Visualization

This repository contains visualizations of the loss curves for a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model. The images provided are:

![Discriminator and Generator Loss](descriminator_and_generator_loss.PNG)

This image shows the loss  for both the discriminator and generator during the training process of the GAN model.  

## 2. `image_by_gan.PNG`

![Image Generated by GAN](image_by_gan.PNG)

This image displays a sample output generated by the trained GAN model. GANs are capable of generating realistic images by learning the underlying distribution of the training data. The generated image showcases the model's ability to create new, plausible samples.
